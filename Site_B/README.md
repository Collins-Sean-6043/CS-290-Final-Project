Hey Joseph, 

This is the second site that creates chess pieces and a board separately but two players on different connections can play through socket.io with the chess pieces being moved in real time when someone is dragging one. The issue with the second is that the chess pieces are moving strangely, when I move one, the other browser seems to snap the piece to the right of where I'm dragging it by a variable length depending on where the piece is loaded in the initial page.
